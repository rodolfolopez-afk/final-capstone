This project is my capstone submission for the Applied Generative AI Specialization. The goal was to create an AI powered business intelligence assistant that can analyze sales data, generate insights, and provide visualizations.

The work is shown in two notebooks.
Capstone Final contains the main analysis, KPI calculations, sales trends, product and regional performance, customer segmentation, statistical measures, and a simple retriever based Q&A system.
Capstone Final Streamlit contains the Streamlit app code that provides a simple interface to view KPIs, charts, and ask questions about the data.

The dataset used is sales_data.csv which was provided.

To run the analysis open Capstone Final in Jupyter Lab.
To run the Streamlit interface use the command
streamlit run app_streamlit.py
